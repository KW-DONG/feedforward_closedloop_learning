\begin{abstract}
  Deep networks so far have been developed on the basis of an error
  signal being back propagated which is generated by comparing a
  desired output to the actual output. However, autonomous agents
  define their errors at their inputs by comparing an inputs to their
  desired or expected states. This is because they act as a closed
  loop system and not open loop. This calls for a network where the
  error is propagated from its input to its output and where the
  feedback from the environment propagates it back it its input. In
  this paper we present a novel learning algorithm which performs
  ``forward-prop'' of the error in parallel to the activation. This
  approach is in line with neuroscience and the philosophy behind
  closed loop systems. We demonstrate it's performance first in a
  simple line follower and then in a first person shooter game.

\section{Introduction}
When an agent acts in its environment, its actions in turn will change
its sensor inputs which in turn will cause new actions -- in short,
the agent acts in a closed-loop system. In the simplest case this is a
reactive system where the agent encounters threats or rewards and acts
accordingly. Both threats and rewards are unpredictable events where
the agent must respond as quickly as possible. These are often called
``disturbances'' or ``perturbations'' because they force the agent to
act at an unpredictable moment in time. Importantly, these occur at
the \textsl{input} of the agent and, thus, a closed loop system
performs ``input control'' -- in contrast to a pattern recognition
system which performs ``output control'' \cite{Phillips2000}.

The above scenario has a major drawback in that the reactions are always
too late. It would be safer for an agent to learn to predict these
disturbances from other cues, which introduces the concept of adaptive behaviour.
At the moment of the disturbance it's already too late - the
tiger has already attacked, or the food has been found by pure
coincidence. However, one can then look back in time and determine
which input signals could have predicted this unexpected
threat or reward \cite{Sutton98,Woergoetter2005,PorrNecoInvco2003}.

Adaptive controllers for this kind of learning are either
correlation-based \cite{Klopf86,PorrNecoISO2003,Verschure91} or state
space-based \cite{Dayan1992,Sutton98}. The state space-based ones can
become very powerful by utilising a deep learning network
\cite{Guo2014}. However, their main drawback is that the state space
approach limits their applicability to real world problems. In
addition, the deep learning architecture requires backprop which
is an open loop algorithm and can only be used by
by embedding them into traditional Q/RL learning
paradigms \cite{Dayan1992,Guo2014}. On the other hand correlation
based-methods can be very fast \cite{Porr2006ICO}, but so far it has
been difficult to use them directly on deep networks. These
correlation based methods use ``input control'', which means that the
error signal is fed into the network at its inputs.

Neurophysiology also supports a forward propagation mechanism
which has first been proposed theoretically by Hebb \cite{Hebb49}
and then confirmed many times that for long term potentiation to happen
both pre- and postsynaptic neurons need to be active \cite{Luescher2012}.
There has been along tradition of work showing that unsupervised
learning is possible in these networks \cite{Linsker88}. However,
here, we are in the realm of reinforcement learning. One solution
is to introduce direct feedback to mimick backproop 
\cite{Lillicrap2016} but this will fail in deeper architectures.
However, there is emerging evidence that different brain oscillations
can carry separate information via the same neurons which allows
transmission of separate streams through the same networks in a
forward fashion \cite{Canolty2010} which are not just separate
streams but also have different impact on plasticity where the
higher frequency components are most likely the ones altering
plasticity and the lower ones are relevant for behaviour and
keep plasticity constant.

How could an error be propagated through a deep network in a forward
fashion? Here we take inspiration from how errors are transmitted in
backprop. In essence the hidden layers receive a \textsl{weighted sum}
of the errors from the previous layers, which makes intuitive sense:
the strongest weights contribute the most to the error. Imagine we
take a similar approach using forward propagation: the error,
introduced at the input, will have its strongest impact via the
largest weights. Therefore we propagate the error in a forward fashion
in the same way as in backprop. Eventually the agent will make an
action and this will feedback to the input of the agent, which in turn
then corrects the weights in all layers.

In this paper we present a novel deep network algorithm for closed
loop systems which we call ``Deep Feedback Learning'' (DFL). This
algorithm marries the ideas for correlation based closed loop learning
with those from deep learning, by turning deep learning from a
backprop-based algorithm to a forward-prop one. We demonstrate this
with two scenarios: a driving task and a 1st-person shooter.

    $v_j$ that predict the disturbances. The network tries to pre-empt these
    disturbances and generate an appropriate action $v_k$.
    \label{closed_loop}}
\end{figure}

\section{Closed loop learning}
Deep feedback learning operates in a closed loop scenario. Before we
describe the algorithm, we need to place it in a closed loop
context. Fig.~\ref{closed_loop} shows the entire closed loop system
with the deep feedback learning as a black box for now. The idea is
that we have a fixed closed loop which is able to fend off
disturbances, such as an unexpected bend on a road or the sudden
appearance of an enemy. This fixed loop then takes appropriate action
to solve this disturbance, e.g. correcting a car's steering, or aiming
towards and shooting an enemy. In formal terms we have a setpoint $SP$
which compares the input of organism to a desired input. If the input
deviates from the setpoint an action is generated with the transfer
function $H_0$. This action then eliminates the disturbance $D$ and
arrives via the environmental transfer function $P_0$ at the input
again; thus, the loop is closed. However, we are not so much
interested in the design of the closed loop but rather that it
generates an \textsl{error signal}. This error signal is non-zero if a
disturbance has happened, and can be used to tune our deep feedback
learning network.

The deep feedback learning network receives additional inputs which are able
to predict the disturbance, and thus prevent the trigger of the feedback
loop. These additional inputs are provided via the transfer function $P_1$
and represent the disturbance in a filtered form. For example a video camera
can provide images of the road ahead, or of an enemy. Deep feedback
learning has the task to take the error signal, and tune its network
to generate actions to minimise the error. In the next section
we describe the deep feedback learning and how this can
compute the appropriate output. Note that deep feedback learning only knows if it has been
successful once its actions have travelled through the environment. Thus learning
evaluates if certain inputs to its network can be used to generate
appropriate actions and these are then slowly transformed into actions.
For that reason the error signal is propagated in a \textsl{forward} fashion
through the network.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{netw_together}
  \caption{A) Network overview. With the exception of the input layer, every
    neuron is a composite cell with an activation $v$ and an error
    term $e$. These are propagated through the network in a weighted
    fashion in parallel.  B) Computation in a single composite cell.
    The presynaptic activities $v_j$ and error signals $e_j$ are used
    to perform correlation based learning and change the weight
    $w_{kj}$ which weights for both activity and error propagation towards the next
    layer.\label{netw_together}}
\end{figure}


\section{Deep feedback learning}
We define a network with an input layer, hidden units and an output
layer which can all have different numbers of neurons (see
Fig~\ref{netw_together}A). In contrast to traditional
networks, every layer (except for the input layer) consists of two
summation nodes: the actual activity and an error signal. These
are processed in two parallel streams.

Let us first focus on the network activity. We define a multi-layered
network, where every neuron is a standard computational unit that
calculates a weighted sum $v_k$ of its inputs $v_j$ and then applies
an activation function $\Theta(v) = \tanh(v)$:
\begin{equation}
  v_k = \Theta\left( \sum_j w_{jk} v_{j} \right) \label{act_sum}
\end{equation}
where the activity flows from neurons in layer $v_j$ to neurons in
layer $v_k$ multiplied by the weights $w_{jk}$, and this
is then repeated in the next layer. This means that for a network with
$N$ layers we have $N-1$ sets of weights $w_{jk}$.

The weight changes are then updated in a semi-Hebbian fashion:
\begin{equation}
  w_{jk}(t+1) = w_{jk}(t) + \gamma v_j(t)  e_k(t) + \mu w_{jk}(t) \label{learningRule}
\end{equation}
where $v_j(t)$ is the presynaptic activity and $e_k(t)$ is an error
signal attached to the postsynaptic neuron, so the correlation is
calculated between input signals and the error signal with the
standard parameters learning rate $\gamma$ and momentum $\mu$.

We now describe the error signal propagation. As outlined above, the
error signal emerges from the feedback loop, and is injected into the
network at its 1st hidden layer as the ``postsynaptic'' activity. The
weight change for this 1st layer can then be calculated directly with
Eq.~\ref{learningRule} by setting $e_k$ to the error signal of the
feedback loop (see Fig.~\ref{closed_loop}).

For the deeper layers, the error signal is computed as a weighted
sum of the error signals from the previous layer:
\begin{equation}
  e_k = \frac{\left( \sum_j w_{jk} e_{j} \right) \Theta^\prime (v_k) }{\frac{\sum_j {|w_{jk}|}}{\sum_j 1}}
  \label{deepError}
\end{equation}
where the $\Theta^\prime (v) = 1 - v^2$ is the derivative of the
activation function $\Theta(v)$: this limits learning when the unit
approaches saturation, as in backprop. The norm guarantees that
the error propagates through all layers and does not vanish from
layer to layer due to small weights.

A simplified data flow diagram of the learning performed in each layer
is shown in Fig~\ref{netw_together}B, where we see the two processing
streams: both the activity $v_j$ and error signal $e_j$ are weighted
by $w_{jk}$, and summed separately in the next layer. Remember that
for the 1st hidden layer, the error is just the error signal
directly injected from the feedback loop. The diagram omits the error
normalisation, scaling and activation derivative in order to focus on
the main point that learning happens between the error signal and the
presynaptic activity.

Learning is then performed in three steps: first the activity is
propagated through the network, then the error signal is propagated
via the same mechanism, and finally the weights are adjusted. Thus,
both the error signal and the activity is propagated in a forward
fashion. Learning itself can be interpreted as heterosynaptic for the
activity $v_j$ and Hebbian for the error $e_j$.


\section{Derivation of the learning rule}
The learning rule for the 1st layer is ICO learning and it has been
proven that this learning rule creates stable closed loop learning \cite{Porr2006ICO}.
We need to show that a network which implement this rule in a distributed
way behaves still in a stable way. We show this in the z-space to be
able to deal with closed loop. Let's assume two layers $j$ and $k$ where
the input signals to the deep network are signals with index i so that
we have $V_i, V_j$ and $V_k$. The error signal, called $X_0$, can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  X_0 = \frac{P_0 \left[ V_k V_J + D z^{-1} \right]}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
\end{equation}
We know that a weight change $\delta w$ by correlating $X_0$ with an input
$V_i$ leads to convergence in a closed loop system. This can be expressed
as:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta w_{ij} = X_0(z) V_i(-z)
\end{equation}
We need to show now that if we have deeper weights such as $w_{jk}$
that these change in the same way as those of the input layer.  In
order to find this we look at small weight changes in $w_{jk}$ and see
how they are related to the weights in the input layer $w_{ij}$.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial X_0}{\partial w_{jk}} =
    \frac{\partial X_0}{\partial V_j}
    \frac{\partial V_j}{\partial V_k}
    \frac{\partial V_k}{\partial w_{jk}}
\end{equation}    
where
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial X_0}{\partial V_j} = \frac{P_0 V_k}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
\end{equation}
If we assume for now that the layers are just a linear neurons:
\begin{eqnarray}
  V_k &=& \sum_j w_{jk} V_j \\
  V_j &=& \sum_i w_{ij} V_i
\end{eqnarray}
then this yields:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{\partial X_0}{\partial w_{jk}} &=&
    \frac{P_0 V_k}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
    \frac{\partial V_j}{\partial V_k}
    V_j \\
                                        &=&
    \frac{P_0 V_k}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
    \frac{\partial V_j}{\partial V_k}
    \sum_i w_{ij} V_i
\end{eqnarray}    
  if we now multiply this equation with $V_i(-z)=V_j^-$ to indicate a correlation then this
  gives us:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial X_0}{\partial w_{jk}} V_i^- =   
    \frac{P_0 V_k}{1-P_0 \rho H_0}
    \frac{\partial V_j}{\partial V_k}
    \underbrace{\left( \sum_{i^\prime} w_{i^\prime j} V_{i^\prime} \right)}_\textrm{\tiny deep layer error signal} V_i^-
\end{equation}
This means that if we introduce a small change in the deeper weights $w_{jk}$
they will depend on the weighted covariance at the input where this correlation
at the input propagates weighted by the input weights $w_{ij}$ to the deeper layer
$w_{jk}$.

    
\section{Shooter game}
In this scenario, we try to learn to play a first-person shooter
purely from visual inputs. We use the Vizdoom
(http://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/) environment for this purpose, and
train a controller to play against a single pretrained bot from Intel
that ran in the Vizdoom 2016 competition. The setup was as follows:

The images returned from Vizdoom are RGB 160x120. We rendered the
enemy in blue, and formed a reflex signal by finding the bounding box
of the pixels closest to that colour. Note that the reflex is slow and
also inherently noisy, as other events in the game are also rendered
blue (e.g. the ‘flashes’ that happen at respawns). The reflex also
fails at times when the enemy is too distant or too close to the
camera. For learning, we only supply the network with the greyscale
image (Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}G) flattened into a vector of $19200$
inputs, so it is forced to discover purely spatial cues. The reflex is
computed relative to the image centre, so a negative value implies the
enemy is on the left. Shooting behaviour is entirely hardwired: if an
enemy is detected within a threshold of the image centre, the bot
fires. Note that the bot's only actions are to rotate in the plane,
and shoot -- it does not translate (but the enemy does). Instead of
separate outputs for left and right, we have a single value produced
by 3 neurons acting at different sensitivities:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \theta = g_{err}\, \mathrm{error} + g_{net} \left( 10 v_0 + 3 v_1 + v_2 \right)
\end{equation}
where $v_0, \ldots, v_2$ are the network outputs, and $\Delta \theta$
is the change in orientation.

          normalised to zero-mean, unit variance. Learning rate in D
          and E was 0.0001.
		\label{shooter_results}}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Results}
As before, we see that the controller outputs steadily increase over
time (Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}C). With a high value of $g_{net}$,
the bot can make very rapid aiming movements. This has the advantage
that the error can in principle be reduced very quickly; it also
causes the bot to sometimes make large rotations even when the enemy
is out of the field of view, which helps with exploration. On the
other hand, it can cause the aiming to overshoot and oscillate around
the target.  The weights grow in a similar pattern to before, although
their progression is less smooth, due to the more discontinuous nature
of the error signal (Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}E). The different
scales are likely due to the inputs having more dimensions.

Unlike the Line Follower, it is not possible here to drive the error
to zero, as there are discontinuities when either bot respawns, and so
the enemy will often abruptly appear somewhere in the image. One
performance measure is simply how often our bot is killed vs how often
it kills the enemy. In gaming, this is called the kill/death ratio,
and we plot some smoothed KD curves in Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}D. To
do statistics, we measure the time taken to reach a threshold KD of 0.15 -
Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}B shows this as a function of learning
rate. As before, there is a stable region in the middle where learning
is consistently successful. We also plot the smoothed KD for the final
step of each trial(Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}A); although a noisy
measure, the same pattern emerges. Over time, the input weights blur
the background, leaving dark and light blobs to detect the enemy and
generate an aiming response (Fig.~\ref{shooter_results}F).

Note that this is only one skill of a functioning FPS bot, as a real bot would
require additional skills such as seeking rewards (e.g. finding health packs) and
navigating the environment (e.g. avoiding collisions). Future research
will investigate whether the DFL approach can be used to acquire such
skills, using the same fundamental approach of learning to anticipate
a prewired behaviour.


\section{Discussion}
We have shown that a deep network which propagates its errors in a forward
fashion from its inputs to its outputs is able to solve closed loop
learning tasks. We have demonstrated this in both a first person
shooter and a driving scenario.

Closed loop learning which aims to maximise a function or minimise one
is usually referred to as reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to
navigate an action space in a way that it maximises its accumulative
reward \cite{Dayan1992}. The main drawback of this approach
is the discrete state space which makes it hard to solve analogue
problems. To overcome this problem, closed loop learning rules using
correlation-based techniques \cite{Verschure91} were introduced.
These networks perform well in real robot tasks but are usually restricted to 
simple network architectures. DFL addresses this
deficiency by introducing a deep architecture but staying firmly
on correlation-based territory.

Plasticity has always been hotly debated in neurophysiology -- the
general understanding is that a large postsynaptic Calcium
concentration causes LTP \cite{Malenka99,Bennett2000} and a low one
causes LTD \cite{Mulkey1992}. This requires a strong pre-synaptic
drive to achieve a strong postsynaptic activity, and with that Ca
influx \cite{Meunier2017}. In mathematical terms this would just lead
to self-amplification of the synaptic weight, where strong presynaptic
activity would lead to more postsynaptic activity and in turn stronger
weights, and so on. However, suppose the learning signal and the
actual activity were transmitted via the same synapse but were
fundamentally separated \cite{Lindsay2017}, for example by using
different frequencies: high frequency potentials could cause
plasticity changes while low frequency potentials propagate
behaviourally relevant activity \cite{Canolty2010}. DFL would provide
here a mechanism which allows stable behaviourally relevant learning
driven by heterosynaptic plasticity and Hebbian learning for the error
signal which is also stable because it is constantly corrected by the
error signal.

Looking at a system-wide perspective one can see DFL as a flexible
actor which has a high freedom in generating actions as long as they
minimise the error. For example in the basal ganglia the striatum is
seen as an actor receiving an error signal via dopamine, the famous
reward prediction error which is understood of being closely related
to the error of temporal difference learning
\cite{gurney98:_basal_gangl_action_selec_devic}. It is curious that
the striatum receives the error signal but then downstream neurons in
the basal ganglia and the cortex receive little dopaminergic
modulation. However, plasticity is not just happening in the striatum
but in many downstream targets so it makes sense to propagate this
error in a forward fashion downstream as well and not using a dopamine
as a broadcast signal all over the brain which ultimately will provide
much more behavioural flexibility.

A different stance about synaptic plasticity (and ultimately how
autonomous agents learn) has been taken by the deep learning community
which recently claimed that error backpropagation is biologically
realistic \cite{Lillicrap2016,Roelfsema2018}. This has been
demonstrated in a network with one hidden layer by introducing a
separate feedback pathway from the output of the network to this
hidden layer. While this shows promising results it still operates in
an open loop fashion (i.e. output control), and thus contradicts the
requirement for an agent to control its inputs.

Autonomous behaviour can only be understood by observing the whole
loop \cite{Porr2005kyb}, be it reinforcement learning \cite{Sutton98}
or correlation based learning \cite{Verschure91}. Of course not all
feedback loops traverse through the physical environment; they could
be efference copies \cite{Uexkuell26,Graesser86} or gating signals
which are presented to minimise errors. However, even these signals
need to be evaluated at the input of the agent, for example when
stabilising an input image, the goal is itself an image, and therefore
an input and not an output.

Given that in DFL the error is propagated from the input to the output
the novel aspect is that the more layers DFL has, the more it is remote
from the immediate error feedback. This allows for flexibility which
can be tuned by the number of layers, and demonstrates that the agent
performs input control. The actions can be substantially varied as long as
the error signal can be minimised and will be more pronounced with
more hidden layers. In other words the more hidden layers we have the
more behavioural flexibility the agent will show.
