Feedback closed loop learning library
=====================================

The best way to get started is to download the script
in `tests_py` from:
https://github.com/glasgowneuro/feedback_closed_loop_learning

The API is identical to that of the C++ API. `fcl.h`,
`neuron.h` and `layer.h` contain docstrings of
the API.

A full application using the Python API is our vizdoom
agent: https://github.com/glasgowneuro/fcl_demos
